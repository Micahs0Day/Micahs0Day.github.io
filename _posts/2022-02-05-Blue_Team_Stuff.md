## Courses:
***
[SOC Core Skills](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/)

John Strand is a legend in the infosec/cyber space. This "Pay what you can" training is a great way to get introduced to core skills needed by SOC analysts, and the payment model allows practically anyone to participate. I haven't had the privilege of attending this course yet, but it comes highly recommended.

[Splunk Power User](https://www.udemy.com/course/splunk-zero-to-power-user/)

As a SOC analyst, most of your time will be spent inside of a SIEM so itâ€™s profitable to get familiar with one fast. Splunk is a very popular SIEM and takes up a large majority of the market share. This course helps to acclimate you to working with analytics and SPL in Splunk. After taking this course, you put yourself in a great position to pass the "Splunk Core Certified Power User" certification exam. Passing it will make yourself more marketable to recruiters/HR.
