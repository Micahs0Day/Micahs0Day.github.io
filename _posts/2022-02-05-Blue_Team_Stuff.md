# Intro:

This is just a quick braindump of the resources that I used to get acclimated with Cybersecurity, and helped me to land an entry level role as a SOC Analyst. I hope that this brief post will help those who are trying to break into the field. I will continue to edit this page as I think of more resources or come across new ones. God Bless!

<br>

# Courses:
***
> [SOC Core Skills](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/) <br>
John Strand is a legend in the infosec/cyber space. This "Pay what you can" training is a great way to get introduced to core skills needed by SOC analysts, and the payment model allows practically anyone to participate. I haven't had the privilege of attending this course yet, but it comes highly recommended.

> [Splunk Power User](https://www.udemy.com/course/splunk-zero-to-power-user/) <br>
As a SOC analyst most of your time will be spent inside of a SIEM, therefore it’s highly advantageous to get familiar with one fast. Splunk is a very popular SIEM and takes up a large majority of the market share. This course helps to acclimate you to working with searches and SPL in Splunk. After taking this course, you put yourself in a great position to pass the "Splunk Core Certified Power User" certification exam. Passing it will make yourself more marketable to recruiters/HR.

> [MITRE ATT&CK Defender™ (MAD)](https://www.cybrary.it/course/mitre-attack-defender-mad-attack-fundamentals/) <br>
This course was recommended by a Senior colleague. If you want to get more familiar with attacker TTP's/Threat intelligence/Adversary detection, then this is the course for you.

# Certifications:
***
### <ins> Networking Fundamentals: </ins>

> [Cisco CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) <br>
*Probably the most recognized networking certification in the world. Networking is extremely important in Cyber-Security especially for day to day security operations. If you don't take this cert/training, then take the CompTIA Network+ or at least complete the training material. You can find free resources all over YouTube.*

> [CompTIA Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) <br>
*A great certification that gives the student a broad overview of common network protocols, implementations, operations, and troubleshooting. Even includes a bit of network security content.*

> [101 Labs - CompTIA Network+](https://www.amazon.com/101-Labs-CompTIA-Paul-Browning/dp/1726841294/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=101+labs&qid=1614006944&sr=8-2/) <br>
*Networking labs that you can do at home to prepare for the Network+. You can also just do the labs for hands on Networking experience.*

### <ins> Security Operations: </ins>

> [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) <br>
*Fulfills the DoD 8570 compliance requirement and is one of the most well-known Cybersecurity certifications. A lot of private companies require this certification for security operations positions.*

> [CompTIA CySA+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst) <br>
*Next step up from the CySA+. This certification piggybacks on a lot of the material covered in the Security+, great for those wanting to level up their skills and validate their security knowledge.*

### <ins> Hands on Security Operations: </ins>

> [Security Blue Team BTL1](https://securityblue.team/why-btl1/) <br>
*Practical 24-hour incident response exam that covers 6 domains (Security Fundamentals/Phishing Analysis/Threat Intelligence/Digital Forensics/SIEM/Incident Response). Really looking forward to taking this one!!*

> [Certified CyberDefender (CCD)](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-training/courses/certified-cyberdefender/) <br>
*Full disclaimer, not much is known about this certification course, however CyberDefenders is a well known and vetted platform.*

<br>

# Training Platforms:
***
> [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/blueteam) <br>
*The CyberDefender path is phenomenal! Can also be used as a resource to study for the CompTIA CySA+.*

> [LetsDefend.io](https://letsdefend.io/) <br>
*The most realistic SOC/SIEM training platform that I have come across. It's a bit expensive, but if you want hands on SIEM experience then this is the lowest bar to entry*

> [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/) <br>
*Amazing resource, contains tons of hands on lab activities, FOR FREE!!!*

> [Blue Team Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online/) <br>
*Hands on DFIR, security Operations, reverse engineering, threat hunting, and OSINT challenges. (Similar to CyberDefenders, but contains paid elements)*

> [Splunk BOTS](https://bots.splunk.com/) <br>
*Using this currently to level up my SPL/Investigation skills in Splunk. Highly recommend!*
