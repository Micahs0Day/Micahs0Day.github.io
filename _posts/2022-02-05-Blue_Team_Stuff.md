## Start Here (**Under Construction**):


## Networking:

A good place to start is to study for the Network+, this certification will introduce you to the basics of broad spectrum of Networking terminology and technologies. Jason Dion has a great course on Udemy that I used to study for my Network+. You can usually catch this course on sale for under $20.

If you have no networking experience prior to taking the Network+ then I recommend that you get your hands dirty with some lab time. You can build a virtual home networking lab using things like packet tracer or GNS3. There is a book called “101 Labs – CompTIA Network+” by Paul Browning that contains labs that you can build using these tools.

## Basic Troubleshooting/IT skills:

I think the best way to get these kinds of skills is to actually getting a job in helpldesk. There's nothing like having to remediate/troubleshoot user issues. Break/fix things and get your hands dirty in a real enviroment. Of course you can build labs, but the quickest way is getting on the job experience imo. I also heard that the COMTIA A+ is good at getting people the basic IT skills they need to get their feet wet.

## Linux:

## Intro to Penetration Testing: 

[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)

TryHackMe is perfect for complete beginners that have no experience whatsoever. However, this platform also has a lot of content for intermediate/advanced users as well. The "complete beginner" learning path is the perfect place to start, and it covers some of the fundamentals like networking, Linux, and web protocols. It also introduces users to Cryptography, exploitation, privilege escalation, and helps you get familiar with some of the tools of the trade. They also have a very active discord channel, where you can go and ask questions, get help, or just goof off with other people with the same interests.

[TCM Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/)

This platform is also highly recommended. Heath Adams AKA “The Cyber Mentor” is well respected in the infosec community and aims to provide quality & practical content that is also very affordable. The Cyber Mentor produces great content and is an amazing teacher. 

[INE](https://ine.com/pages/cybersecurity)

eLearnSecurity, the creator of the eLearnSecurity certification suite, was recently purchased by INE. I am currently using this platform to study for my eJPT. Their content is amazing, and their training is more geared towards the real world/practical aspects of penetration testing unlike the OSCP, which is more capture the flag based. Also, they do not only teach Cyber-security, but also have great material covering networking, cloud, and data science as well. The eJPT has been regaled as a great introductory level penetration testing certification and is a good starting point for newbies like me.

[Black Cyber-Security Association](https://blackcybersecurityassociation.org/)

The BCA (Black Cyber-Security Association) aims to close the diversity gap in Cyber-Security and tech in general. They have Certification prep groups, clubhouse talks, home-lab tutorials, a very active discord, and are becoming a very prominent force in the Cyber-Security community. This is a group where you can find a mentor, volunteer your time, and become a part of something greater than yourself. The BCA is also inclusive, meaning that anyone can join.
