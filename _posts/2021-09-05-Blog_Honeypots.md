## Honeypot Overview:
Honeypots and other deception technologies are used to mimic legitimate systems and trick attackers into interacting with them. Honeypots have many use cases, including misdirection, gathering threat intelligence, creating high fidelity alerts and more. Thankfully, due to the creative and talented infosec community, there are tons of open-source honeypot projects that create a very low barrier to entry to start using deception technology in your home/corporate networks. 

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”
-Sun Tzu
