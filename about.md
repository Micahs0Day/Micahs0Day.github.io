Cyber-Security Professional with strong technical expertise in the field of system administration with a concentration in Cyber-Security. I have over two years in the corporate tech space, dealing with virtualization, Windows/Linux administration, networking, server management, vulnerability management, firewall administration and more. Also, I recently started my Cyber-Security career as a incident response analyst at a major healthcare provider.

Passionate for all things tech, both software and hardware related. In my spare time I tinker with my home lab, do rooms on TryHackMe, listen to Cyber-Security podcasts and tinker with electronics including raspberry pi's, Arduino, and 3D printers. Also I love modding/playing PC games, PCMR!!
